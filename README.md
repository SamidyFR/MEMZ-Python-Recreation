# MEMZ-Python-Recreation
This Recreation of MEMZ is A Simple Python Recreation Made For Fun/Whatever.

This is a Malware-free/Epilepsy-free Safe Version.
Its very Simple, Recreates Some of the Core Parts of the Virus. Such as:
- Google Searches
- Website Visits
- MEMZ message
- And a Bit more

But does not:

- Destory the Boot Sector
- Flash Colors
- Have Sound
- Pretty Much all the Bad Stuff.

This Script is VERY simple. only about 20 lines of code.
I Dont Know if this Will Help any Beginners (Probably Not) But i Hope it Will.

There Are other Python Recreations That Are far More advanced. Like:

But, This one is Supposed to be Short, Simple, And without all the Epileptic stuff.

All and all this was made for fun (i ❤️ Python)
